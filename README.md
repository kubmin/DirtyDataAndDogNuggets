# Dirty Data and Dog Nuggets

Over the last years we have seen many examples of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, acting in unpredictable ways. Their actions are based on what they learn from our input data, which is infected with inaccurate and incomplete Dirty Data. This affects the process and given output of these algorithms. When we look back at these sensitive learning methods, we can understand more about our misconceptions, in an attempt to reconsider our ethics.

The current revolution in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has great impact on the world today.
Companies boost the industry, and we see machine learning implemented in many aspects of life: health, education, finance, law, advertising and social relations.
But what is the impact of outsourcing decisions to cold-logic-machines?

In the course you will be introduced to a general topic of AI and experiment with a variety of techniques. We will look at the possibilities and disabilities within the domain, and ask ourselves the question:
Does the machine really get the joke?

An elective constructed out of presentations, workshops, discussions and an excursion to the Neuhaus exhibition in Het Nieuwe instituut. Here we will execute experiments in Neulab (the educational space), to investigate more-than-human knowledge.
